# Tooling Website deployment automation with Continuous Integration
## Introduction to Jenkins

In this project, the primary goal is to automate the deployment of a tooling website by implementing Continuous Integration (CI) using Jenkins on an Ubuntu server. This process will streamline the workflow by ensuring that code changes are automatically built, tested, and deployed with minimal manual intervention. By leveraging Jenkins, we aim to create an efficient pipeline that handles code versioning, testing, and deployment to the production environment in a reliable, repeatable, and consistent manner. This provides us with the follwoing benefit:

1. **Automation of Repetitive Tasks**: Jenkins allows us to automate the entire build and deployment process, saving time and reducing the potential for human errors.
2. **Continuous Integration**: Every time code is pushed to the repository, Jenkins automatically triggers a build, ensuring that any issues or bugs are caught early in the development process.
3. **Improved Collaboration**: As Jenkins integrates with GitHub, all team members can collaborate efficiently, with the assurance that their changes will be tested and deployed automatically.
4. **Efficient Deployment**: Jenkins ensures that deployment is consistent across environments, whether to development, staging, or production servers.
5. **Extensibility with Plugins**: Jenkins has a large repository of plugins that can be integrated into the pipeline, offering functionalities such as notifications, testing frameworks, and deployment strategies.
